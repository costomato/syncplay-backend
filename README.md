# SyncPlay backend
SyncPlay is a video synchronization app that allows friends to watch videos together without the hassle of connecting over a video call and dealing with poor latency. With SyncPlay, users can join a room created by one person and the video will play for all users at the same time. This eliminates the need for everyone to press play at the same time and ensures a seamless viewing experience for everyone.

## Technical Details
The app is built with Kotlin on the frontend and the backend is built with Ktor. The full-stack uses websockets to connect clients.
This backend uses the ktor-server framework. You'll find client side app [here](https://github.com/costomato/SyncPlay).
